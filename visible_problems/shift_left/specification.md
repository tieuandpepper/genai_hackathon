This module implements a combinational barrel left shifter for a vector of symbols. It is designed to operate on an input vector of 8 symbols, where each symbol is 12 bits wide.

The module shifts the input vector `in` to the left by a number of symbol positions specified by the 3-bit `shift` input. The shifted result is produced on the `out` port.

The functionality is as follows:
- For a given shift amount, an output symbol `out[i]` gets its value from the input symbol `in[i - shift]`, for all symbol indices `i` that are greater than or equal to the shift amount.
- The symbol positions vacated by the shift operation (i.e., indices `i` from 0 up to `shift - 1`) are filled with the value provided by the 12-bit `fill` input.

For example, if the `shift` input is 2, the output `out` will be composed of `{in[5], in[4], in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0], fill, fill}`.

The module also validates the shift amount. It is configured to support a maximum shift of 5 positions. If the `shift` input value is within the legal range of 0 to 5 (inclusive), the `out_valid` signal is asserted high. If the `shift` input exceeds 5, `out_valid` is de-asserted low to indicate an invalid operation. The output `out` is still driven for invalid shift amounts, but its value is not guaranteed to be meaningful.
