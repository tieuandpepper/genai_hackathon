This module implements a synchronous, 13-entry, 8-bit wide First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer. It operates with a single clock (`clk`) and is reset by a synchronous, active-high signal (`rst`).

The primary function is to buffer data between a producer (push side) and a consumer (pop side) using a standard ready/valid handshake protocol.

### **Interfaces and Handshake**

*   **Push Interface:** A data producer can push an 8-bit word (`push_data`) into the FIFO. A push transaction is accepted on a clock cycle when both the producer's `push_valid` signal and the FIFO's `push_ready` signal are high. The `push_ready` signal is asserted by the FIFO whenever it is not full.
*   **Pop Interface:** A data consumer can pop an 8-bit word (`pop_data`) from the FIFO. A pop transaction occurs on a clock cycle when both the FIFO's `pop_valid` signal and the consumer's `pop_ready` signal are high. The `pop_valid` signal is asserted by the FIFO whenever it contains at least one valid item.

### **Functional Behavior**

The FIFO has two primary modes of operation depending on its state:

1.  **Bypass (Cut-through) Mode:** When the FIFO is empty, it operates in a bypass mode. If a new item is pushed (`push_valid` is high) while the consumer is ready to accept it (`pop_ready` is high), the data is passed directly from the push interface to the pop interface in the same clock cycle. In this scenario, `push_data` appears on `pop_data` and `pop_valid` is asserted high combinationally. This provides a zero-cycle latency for data transfers through an empty FIFO.

2.  **Buffered Mode:** When the FIFO is not empty, or when it is empty but the consumer is not ready (`pop_ready` is low), pushed data is stored internally. Data is read from the head of the internal storage and presented at the `pop_data` output. When an item is popped, the next item in the queue becomes available at the `pop_data` output on the following clock cycle.

The `pop_data` and `pop_valid` outputs are not driven by a dedicated final register stage. They are driven combinationally from either the push inputs (during bypass) or the internal memory's read output.

### **Reset**

When `rst` is asserted high, the FIFO is cleared and reset to its initial state:
*   It becomes empty.
*   `pop_valid` is de-asserted to `0`.
*   `push_ready` is asserted to `1`.
*   All status flags are updated to reflect an empty FIFO (`empty` = 1, `full` = 0, `items` = 0, `slots` = 13).

### **Status Flags**

The module provides several status flags to monitor its state:

*   `full`: A signal that is high when the FIFO cannot accept any new entries.
*   `empty`: A signal that is high when the FIFO contains no valid entries.
*   `items`: A counter indicating the exact number of valid entries currently stored in the FIFO.
*   `slots`: A counter indicating the number of available empty spaces in the FIFO.
*   `full_next`, `empty_next`, `items_next`, `slots_next`: These signals predict the state of their corresponding status flags for the next clock cycle. They are calculated based on the current state and the pending push/pop transactions, allowing for single-cycle lookahead logic by the surrounding design.
