This module implements a combinational barrel right shifter for a vector of symbols.

Based on the default parameterization, the module operates on a vector of 10 symbols, with each symbol being 5 bits wide.

### Functional Description

The module performs a logical right shift on the input vector `in` by the number of symbol positions specified by the 3-bit `shift` input. The shifted result is driven to the `out` port.

For a given shift amount `S`, the output symbol `out[i]` is assigned the value of the input symbol `in[i + S]`. The `S` most significant symbol positions in the `out` vector, which are vacated by the shift operation, are filled with the 5-bit value provided by the `fill` input.

### Port Descriptions

*   **`in`**: A 10-element input vector, where each element is a 5-bit symbol. This is the data to be shifted.
*   **`shift`**: A 3-bit input that specifies the number of symbol positions to shift `in` to the right.
*   **`fill`**: A 5-bit input value used to fill the vacated symbol positions at the most significant end of the output vector.
*   **`out_valid`**: A single-bit output that indicates if the requested `shift` amount is valid. It is high if `shift` is between 0 and 4, inclusive. If `shift` is greater than 4, this signal is low, and the `out` data should be considered invalid.
*   **`out`**: A 10-element output vector of 5-bit symbols, representing the result of the right shift operation.
