This module implements a purely combinatorial binary-to-Gray code converter. It takes a 10-bit binary input, `bin`, and produces a 10-bit Gray code output, `gray`.

The conversion logic is as follows:

1.  The most significant bit (MSB) of the output `gray` is identical to the MSB of the input `bin`.
    *   `gray[9] = bin[9]`

2.  Each of the remaining bits of the output `gray` is generated by the bitwise XOR of the corresponding bit and the next more significant bit of the input `bin`.
    *   `gray[i] = bin[i+1] ^ bin[i]` for `i` from 0 to 8.

The entire operation can be expressed as a bitwise XOR between the input `bin` and the input `bin` right-shifted by one position. The output `gray` is updated combinatorially with any change in the input `bin`.
