This module implements a 17-entry, 8-bit wide, clock domain crossing (CDC) First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer. It is designed to connect a data producer operating on `push_clk` to a data consumer operating on `pop_clk`. The internal storage is implemented using a register file (flop-RAM).

### Clocking and Reset
The module operates across two independent clock domains. The write interface is synchronous to the rising edge of `push_clk`, and the read interface is synchronous to the rising edge of `pop_clk`.

The module has two active-high synchronous resets, `push_rst` for the write domain and `pop_rst` for the read domain. These reset signals are internally registered, meaning their effect is delayed by one clock cycle in their respective domains.

An additional reset handshake is provided on the push side. The `push_sender_in_reset` input signals that the upstream module is in reset. The FIFO's write-side logic will enter and remain in reset as long as either `push_rst` or `push_sender_in_reset` is asserted. The `push_receiver_in_reset` output is asserted to inform the upstream module of the FIFO's reset state.

### Push Interface (Write Operation)
The write interface uses a credit-based flow control mechanism.
-   A write transaction is initiated by the upstream module asserting `push_valid` for one `push_clk` cycle. On that cycle, the 8-bit `push_data` is captured and written into the FIFO.
-   For every item successfully read from the pop side, the FIFO returns a credit by pulsing the `push_credit` output high for one `push_clk` cycle. The upstream logic is responsible for tracking these credits to know when it is permitted to send data.
-   The `push_credit` signal is generated combinationally based on read-side activity.
-   The return of credits can be paused by asserting the `push_credit_stall` input.

### Pop Interface (Read Operation)
The read interface uses a standard ready/valid handshake.
-   The FIFO asserts `pop_valid` to indicate that valid data is available on the 8-bit `pop_data` output.
-   A read transaction is completed, and the item is dequeued from the FIFO, on a `pop_clk` cycle where both `pop_valid` and the downstream module's `pop_ready` input are high.
-   If `pop_valid` is high but `pop_ready` is low, the FIFO will hold the same data at its output until the handshake completes.
-   The `pop_valid` and `pop_data` outputs are not internally registered, which allows for a combinational cut-through path from the push interface to the pop interface when the FIFO is empty.

### Status and Credit Management
The module provides several status signals for monitoring and control.

**Push-Side Status:**
-   `push_full`: Asserts high when the FIFO has no available space.
-   `push_slots`: A counter indicating the number of empty slots available in the FIFO.
-   `credit_initial_push`: An input that defines the total number of credits the system starts with at reset.
-   `credit_withhold_push`: An input that specifies a number of credits to be permanently withheld from the sender. This can be used to reduce the effective depth of the FIFO.
-   `credit_count_push`: The FIFO's internal count of total credits.
-   `credit_available_push`: The number of credits available to the sender, calculated as the internal credit count minus the withheld credits.

**Pop-Side Status:**
-   `pop_empty`: Asserts high when the FIFO contains no data.
-   `pop_items`: A counter indicating the number of valid data items currently stored in the FIFO.

### Internal Synchronization
To manage its state across the two clock domains, the FIFO's internal read and write pointers are synchronized using a 2-stage synchronizer. This structure is designed to minimize the probability of metastability when communicating status information (like full and empty conditions) between the `push_clk` and `pop_clk` domains.
