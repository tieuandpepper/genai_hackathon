This module implements a 5-bit Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It contains a 5-bit state register that is updated on the positive edge of `clk`.

### Initialization and Reset

Upon a synchronous, active-high `rst`, the internal state is loaded with the value from the `initial_state` input.

The state can also be reinitialized synchronously by asserting the `reinit` signal high. When `reinit` is high, the state is loaded with `initial_state` on the next positive clock edge. This reinitialization operation takes precedence over the normal state advancement.

### State Advancement

The LFSR state transitions when the `advance` input is high. If both `advance` and `reinit` are low, the state holds its current value.

The next state is computed as follows:
1.  A single feedback bit is calculated by first performing a bitwise AND between the current 5-bit state (available on `out_state`) and the 5-bit `taps` input.
2.  The 5 bits resulting from the AND operation are then XOR-reduced to a single bit.
3.  The new state is formed by a shift operation. The four least significant bits of the current state (`out_state[3:0]`) become the four most significant bits of the new state. The most significant bit of the current state is discarded.
4.  The calculated feedback bit becomes the new least significant bit of the state.

### Outputs

The module provides two outputs:
*   `out_state`: A 5-bit output that reflects the full current state of the LFSR.
*   `out`: A single-bit output that is always equal to the least significant bit of the current state (`out_state[0]`).
