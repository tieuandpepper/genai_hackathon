This module implements the receiver-side logic for a credit-based flow control system. It is designed for a single data flow with an 8-bit data width. The system can manage a maximum of one credit. It features a zero-cycle, combinational data path from its push interface to its pop interface, meaning it does not buffer data itself.

### Reset Behavior
The module enters a reset state if either the primary reset `rst` is asserted or the `push_sender_in_reset` input is asserted. When in this reset state:
- The internal credit counter is initialized with the value of the `credit_initial` input.
- All data transfers are blocked: `pop_valid` is deasserted.
- No credits are returned to the sender: `push_credit` is deasserted.
- The `push_receiver_in_reset` output is asserted if `rst` is high, signaling the module's reset status to the sender. This output is a direct, combinational reflection of the `rst` input.

### Data and Validity Path
The module provides a direct, combinational path for data and its validity signal.
- `pop_data` is always assigned the value of `push_data`.
- `pop_valid` is asserted if and only if `push_valid` is asserted and the module is not in a reset state (i.e., both `rst` and `push_sender_in_reset` are low).

### Credit Management
At its core, the module contains a 1-bit credit counter that tracks the number of available transaction slots in the downstream buffer. The state of this counter is continuously driven on the `credit_count` output.

- **Initialization:** On reset, the counter is loaded with the 1-bit value from `credit_initial`.
- **Increment:** The counter is incremented at the rising edge of `clk` if the `pop_credit` input is asserted (value of 1), which signifies that the downstream buffer has consumed an item and freed up a slot.
- **Decrement:** The counter is decremented at the rising edge of `clk` if a credit is successfully sent back to the sender (i.e., `push_credit` was asserted in the previous cycle).
- **Credit Withholding:** The `credit_withhold` input can be used to dynamically reserve a credit, preventing it from being sent. The `credit_available` output reflects the number of credits available to be sent back to the sender after accounting for any withheld credits. It is calculated combinatorially as `credit_count` - `credit_withhold`.

### Push Interface Credit Generation
The module returns credits to the sender via the 1-bit `push_credit` output. This output is combinational. A credit is returned (`push_credit` is asserted) in a given cycle if all of the following conditions are true:
1. The module is not in a reset state (`rst` and `push_sender_in_reset` are both low).
2. The `push_credit_stall` input is low.
3. There is at least one credit available to be sent, as indicated by the `credit_available` output being non-zero.
